Idiot Rewrite
=============

**Philosophies**
* Only pass iterables of Card instances rather than just instances
* Make game control flow as understandable as possible by abstracting to verbosely-named functions
* Make game control function scope as logical as possible (e.g. play\_from\_faceups in Player class, no pickup\_func in Pile class)

**Tasks**
* AI Classes and methods to match needs of CPU turn
* Interface functions (Graphics)
* Graphics

**Completed**
* Interface functions (CLI)
* Game Engine functions: get input, get name, playable/can play, choose, sort cards
* Game Engine classes: Game which will control and progress game state
* Game Engine classes: Human
* Game Engine class method: turn
* Game Engine classes: Card, Deck, Pile, Three

**Graphics**
* Gather/create static files
* Gameframe
* Upgrade functions and objects
