Idiot Card Game
===============

**Philosophies**
* Make game control flow as understandable as possible by abstracting to verbosely-named functions
* Make game control function scope as logical as possible (e.g. play\_from\_faceups in Player class)

**Tasks**
* Simplify/improve(/debug)
* AI method: AI.cpu\_choose()
* Graphics (See below)
* Interface functions for graphics (Right now, CLI is employed)

**Graphics**
* Gather/create static files
* Create gameframe
* Make interface functions happen in the gameframe
* Animate gameplay
