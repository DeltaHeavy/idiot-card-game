Idiot Card Game
===============

(Yes the game is called idiot, we can play it in class on tuesday as research)

**Philosophies**
* Only pass iterables of Card instances rather than just instances
* Make game control flow as understandable as possible by abstracting to verbosely-named functions
* Make game control function scope as logical as possible (e.g. play\_from\_faceups in Player class)

**Tasks**
* Debug, test, simplify/improve
* AI method: AI.cpu\_choose()
* Interface functions (Graphics)
* Graphics

**Graphics**
* Gather/create static files
* Gameframe
* Make interface and graphics happen in the gameframe
